Consider following Relation:
Companies(comp_id, name, cost, year)
Orders(comp_id, domain, quantity)
Execute the following query:
1. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using
inner join.
2. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using
left outer join.
3. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using
right outer join.
4. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using
Union operator.
5. Create View View1 by selecting both tables to show company
name and quantities.
6. Create View View2 by selecting any two columns and perform
insert update delete operations.
7. Display content of View1, View2
