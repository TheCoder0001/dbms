CREATE TABLE Customers(
   Cust_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
   Cust_name VARCHAR2(30),
   Salary NUMBER

INSERT INTO Customers VALUES(1,'Rohan',50000);
INSERT INTO Customers VALUES(2,'Priya',62000);

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_Customer_Salary
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Old Salary: '||:OLD.Salary||' New Salary: '||:NEW.Salary);
