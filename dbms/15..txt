Write a PL/SQL code block to calculate the area of a circle for a
value of radius varying from 5 to 9. Store the radius and the
corresponding values of calculated area in an empty table named
areas, consisting of two columns, radius and area.



CREATE TABLE areas(radius NUMBER, area NUMBER);

DECLARE
  r NUMBER := 5;
  ar NUMBER;
BEGIN
  WHILE r <= 9 LOOP
    ar := 3.14 * r * r;
    INSERT INTO areas VALUES(r, ar);
    r := r + 1;
  END LOOP;
END;
