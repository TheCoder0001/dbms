Consider following Relation
Employee(emp_id,employee_name,street,city)
Works(employee_name,company_name,salary)
Company(company_name,city)
Manages(employee_name,manager_name)
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary
key, foreign key, not null etc.
1. Find the names of all employees who work for „TCS‟.

all employees who work for 'TechM' and earn more than $10,000.
5. Add Column Asset to Company table.
